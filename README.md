## <<-< Template Notes >->>

<br/>

This is a template I used and created for building my first ever overwolf application for a game called `New World`.

Thats then also the game this template is set up for, Read the next parts to make sure it works for `your game`.

<hr/>
<br/>

## <<-< Game Setup >->>

<br/>

Change [global.ts](__blank) & [manifest.json](__blank) with the `game specific id code`.

you can find the numbers representing your game on overwolf's documentation, there is a nice searchbar!
